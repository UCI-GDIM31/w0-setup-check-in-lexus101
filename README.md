# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

My name is Lexuan Li, he/him. My preferred name is Leo. I am interesting in games because I play games and I want to design games that others would found fun and entertaining. I am taking this class so that I can learn how to program a game and design my own unique game. I have tried unity but I didn't learn much about coding. I do have a card game concept that I am working on as of now, but I lack the skill to program it in unity.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [0] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)

    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
To learn how to code and program and design/create my own game.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

The coding/programming aspect might be too hard.

## Prior Experience
